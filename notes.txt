here i will be taking notes on this course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82hnvUYY6QA
ajax = asynchronous javascript and xml
 -> set of web technologies to send and receive data from a client to a server asynchronously (no page reload)
 -> JSON has replaced XML in this sense

xhr = xml http request
axios is based on ajax

xhr object (xml http object)
-> api in the form of an object
-> provided by the browser's JS env
-> methods transfer data between client/server
-> can be used with other protocols than http
-> cam work with data other than XML (JSON, plain text etc)

libraries and other methods
-> jQuery -> overkill if only for ajax
-> axios -> good for ajax
-> superagent -> good for ajax
-> fetch api -> fairly new, might not work on all browsers
-> prototype
-> node http
